# Cookiecutter Serverless Application Development

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for developing
Serverless applications via Docker.

This is a template which you can use to bootstrap your own project. In order to execute this
template, you'll need `cookiecutter` which is a Python package. See
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) for detailed instructions:

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter


Once you have `cookiecutter` installed, you can use this template to setup your Serverless project:

    cookiecutter  https://github.com/brianz/cookiecutter-serverless.git

For usage, see the `README` which will be generated automatically.
